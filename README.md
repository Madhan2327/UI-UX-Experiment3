# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
To Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App

## Algorithm:
1.Select and Compare 2–3 Competitor Apps/Websites
2.Perform Heuristic Evaluation
3.Analyze and Document Findings
4.Propose and Apply Improvements

## Procedure:

1.Open the existing Swiggy app and observe where the Reorder option is placed (bottom navigation/orders tab).

2.Note down the steps a user must follow to reorder food in the current design.

3.Create a redesigned prototype of Swiggy where the Quick Reorder button is placed at the top of the home screen (next to filters/offers).

4.Ask users to perform the same task — “Reorder your last meal” — on both versions (original and redesigned).

5.Record usability factors: time taken, number of taps, ease of finding Reorder option, and user satisfaction.

6.Compare both versions to check if the redesigned placement improves visibility, control, and speed.

Document user feedback and analyze whether the new design gives a better UX than the original.

Heuristic Evaluation:

## UI/UX Comparison: Zomato vs Swiggy

## 1. Reorder Placement

## Zomato:

The “Reorder” option is usually found in the profile/orders section.

Requires 2–3 taps → Profile → Orders → Select → Reorder.

Not very visible, so many casual users may not notice it.

## Swiggy:

The “Reorder” option is placed in the bottom navigation bar (Home/Orders tab).

Easier than Zomato but still requires navigating to a separate section.

Competes with other nav bar options (Home, Search, Cart, Account).

## User Effort

Zomato: Higher effort (more taps, less discoverable).

Swiggy: Moderate effort (1 extra step, still not in the main focus area).

## Visibility

Zomato: Low visibility since it’s hidden under profile/orders.

Swiggy: Medium visibility, but at the bottom → less priority space.

## Benefits of My Design (Quick Reorder at the Top)
 
## 1. High Visibility

Placing Quick Reorder at the top bar (next to offers & filters) makes it the first thing users see.

Frequent users don’t need to scroll or dig through menus.

## 2. Reduced User Effort

One-tap reorder directly from the homepage → no navigation required.

Saves time, especially for users who order the same meals regularly.

## 3. Better User Retention

Users who find ordering fast and effortless are more likely to keep using the app.

Encourages loyalty from repeat customers.

## 4. Contextual Placement

By putting Quick Reorder next to Fast Delivery & Discounts, it feels like part of a smart suggestion system, not just a hidden feature.

## 5. Competitive Advantage

Improves upon Zomato’s weak visibility and Swiggy’s moderate visibility.

Your design creates a clear USP (Unique Selling Point): “Reordering is effortless on this app.”

## Result:
The Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App is created and verified.
